# Changelog

## Unreleased — 2026-09-24

Production-hardening changes merged after 0.1.0. The package version is still
0.1.0; these changes have not been published as a 0.1.1 release.

### Security
- Escaped, multiline and nested sensitive mapping values are redacted before source evidence is emitted; TLS verification rejects all falsy effective settings.
- Live AWS account attribution is checked through STS even with a configured expected account.
- Report imports reject ambiguous JSON, unsafe file paths and invalid security attributes before generating inventory stubs.
- GitHub/GitLab API downloads use enumerated immutable blob IDs; links, submodules and malformed Base64 produce incomplete coverage.
- Accountless short AWS IDs cannot approve a registry entry; their scans report incomplete coverage until an account is supplied.
- Filesystem scans reject symlinked root paths and report skipped in-scope symbolic links as incomplete coverage.
- Injected HTTP sessions cannot retain origin-specific adapters that bypass destination checks; default buffered responses have a decoded-byte limit.
- Scan configuration rejects missing required environment values, duplicate authored YAML keys, invalid gate settings, and unsupported top-level options.
- Finding identity no longer includes `kind`; promotion from framework-usage to agent preserves merge/diff/incremental identity.
- Shared HTTP client bounds JSON response bodies by default.
- Injected `requests.Session` objects still receive the destination-policy adapter.
- Missing `${ENV}` expansions for required secrets fail closed instead of becoming empty strings.
- Full Apache-2.0 LICENSE text and NOTICE.

### Reliability
- Identity/low-code pagination retains valid neighbors and partial observations, rejects provider failures, and recognizes documented Google empty-list envelopes.
- GCP Cloud Run lists concrete locations; unreachable regions are incomplete. Azure ARM pages preserve observations while incomplete diagnostic collections remain unknown.
- AWS and OCI SDK clients use finite transport/retry bounds; AWS Lambda and GCP project limits stop enumeration early.
- Relative inventory globs and work directories resolve beside their configuration file.
- A later Azure Resource Graph page failure retains already observed resources and reports incomplete coverage; GCP caller attribution is scoped by project.
- Concurrent connector completion order no longer determines merged finding ownership or metadata.
- CLI documents exit 3 (incomplete), exit 2 (`--fail-on` on a complete scan), and Click's separate usage-error path.

### Operations
- Repeated gateway headers reuse bounded per-scan classification summaries; regex contention retries retain their original CPU and input deadlines.
- Docker build context uses an explicit input allowlist, Actions checkout drops persisted credentials, and both CI matrix jobs finish independently.
- Incremental fingerprints ignore literal excluded source directories while retaining CODEOWNERS inputs; project-root attribution scales with active ancestors in wide monorepos.
- Disposable non-root worker image (`Dockerfile`).
- CI runs lint, audit, test, and package checks in each Python matrix job, with a concurrency group.
- Example GitHub Action and README use commit-pinned install examples and document incomplete-scan gating.
- `docs/production.md` rollout checklist: split credentials, egress controls, tenant canaries, reports-as-secret.

### Migration
- Finding IDs for promoted resources change with these commits. Rebuild comparison baselines and incremental state when upgrading from an earlier revision.
- Install from a reviewed tag/SHA. Do not follow `main`.

### Known limits
- The engine has no per-connector deadline. A blocked cloud SDK call can keep a scan running until the host job timeout.
- SDK timeouts and retry limits do not establish a universal deadline for authentication chains or whole scans; workers still require a host deadline.
- Incremental cache writes are atomic and validated by fingerprint, but concurrent scanner processes do not acquire an exclusive state lock.
